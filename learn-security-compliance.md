# Security and Compliance
{: #security-compliance}

## Protection Against Unauthorized Access

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd_full}} use the following methods to protect data in transit or in storage.
- All {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} connections use TLS/SSL encryption for data in transit. The current supported version of this encryption is TLS 1.2.
- Access to the Account, Management Console UI, and API is secured via [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](/docs/services/databases-for-etcd?topic=cloud-databases-iam).
- Access to the database is secured through the standard access controls provided by the database. These access controls are configured to require valid database-level credentials that are obtainable only through prior access to the database or through our Management Console UI or API.
- All {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} storage is provided on storage encrypted with [{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}](/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about). Bring-your-own-key (BYOK) for encryption is also available through [Key Protect](/docs/services/databases-for-etcd?topic=cloud-databases-key-protect).
- IP Whitelisting - All deployments support [whitelisting IP addresses](/docs/services/databases-for-etcd?topic=cloud-databases-whitelisting) to restrict access to the service.
- Public and Private Networking - {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} is integrated with [Service Endpoints](/docs/services/databases-for-etcd?topic=cloud-databases-service-endpoints). You can select whether to use connections over the public network, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} internal network, or both.

## Data Resilience

- [Backups](/docs/services/databases-for-etcd?topic=cloud-databases-dashboard-backups) are included in the service. {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} backups reside in [{{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-ibm-cloud-object-storage) and are also [encrypted](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-security).
- All {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} deployments are configured with replication to provide both data resilience and [high-availability](/docs/services/databases-for-etcd?topic=databases-for-etcd-high-availability). Deployments contain a cluster with three nodes where all the nodes store data and maintain state with a quorum. 
- If you deploy to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Single-Zone Region (SZR), each database node resides on a different host in the datacenter. 
- If you deploy to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Multi-Zone Region (MZR), the nodes are spread over the region's availability zone locations.
