# Security and Compliance


## Protection Against Unauthorized Access

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd_full}} use the following methods to protect data in transit or in storage.
- All {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} connections use TLS/SSL encryption for data in transit. The current supported version of this encryption is TLS 1.2.
- Access to the Account, Management Console UI, and API is secured via IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- Access to the database is secured through the standard access controls provided by the database. These access controls are configured to require valid database-level credentials that are obtainable only through prior access to the database or through our Management Console UI or API.
- All {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} storage is provided on encrypted volumes that use the Linux Unified Keys Setup (LUKS). If you require bring-your-own-key (BYOK) for encryption, it is available through [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Key Protect](https://{DomainName}/docs/services/key-protect/about.html#about). 
- IP Whitelisting - All deployments support whitelisting IP addresses to restrict access to the service.

## Data Resilience

- Backups are included in the service. {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} backups reside in the same cloud storage location as the database service itself, and so are also encrypted.
- All {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} deployments are configured with replication, so the data exists with multiple copies and each copy resides on a different cluster and host. Where available, those clusters are also spread in different availability zones within the region where the service is deployed.
