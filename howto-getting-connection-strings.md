# Creating Users and Getting Connection Strings
{: #connection-strings}

In order to connect to {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd_full}}, you need some users and connection strings. Connection Strings for your deployment are displayed on the _Dashboard Overview_, in the _Endpoints_ panel. 

![Endpoints panel](images/getting-started-endpoints-panel.png){: caption="Figure 1. Endpoints panel" caption-side="bottom"}

You can also grab connection strings from the [CLI](/docs/databases-cli-plugin?topic=databases-cli-plugin-cdb-reference#deployment-connections) and the [API](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/cloud-databases-api#discover-connection-information-for-a-deployment-f-e81026). 

A {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} deployment is provisioned with a root user, and after you [set the root password](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=databases-for-etcd-root-password), you can use its connection strings to connect to your deployment.

## More Users and Connection Strings
{: #additional-users-conn-strings}

Access to your {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} deployment is not limited to the root user. You can create users by using the _Service Credentials_ panel, the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} CLI, or through the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} API. 

All users on your deployment can use the connection strings, including connection strings for either public or private endpoints.

When you create a user, it is assigned certain database roles and privileges. These privileges include the ability to log in and read/write access to the entire key space. For more information, see the [Managing Users and Roles](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=databases-for-etcd-user-management) page.

### Creating Users and Getting Connection Strings in _Service Credentials_
{: #create-users-get-conn-strings-service-cred}

1. Navigate to the service dashboard for your service.
2. Click _Service Credentials_ to open the _Service Credentials_ panel.
3. Click **New Credential**.
4. Choose a descriptive name for your new credential. 
5. (Optional) Specify whether the new credentials use a public or private endpoint. Use either `{ "service-endpoints": "public" }` / `{ "service-endpoints": "private" }` in the _Add Inline Configuration Parameters_ field to generate connection strings using the specified endpoint. Use of the endpoint is not enforced. It just controls which hostnames are in the connection strings. Public endpoints are generated by default.
6. Click **Add** to provision the new credentials. A username and password, and an associated etcd user is auto-generated.

The new credentials appear in the table, and the connection strings are available as a JSON object in the click-to-copy field under _View Credentials_.

### Creating Users and Getting Connection Strings from the command line
{: #create-users-get-conn-strings-cli}

If you manage your service through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and the [cloud databases plug-in](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli), you can create a new user with `cdb user-create`. For example, to create a new user for an "example-deployment", use the following command.
```sh
ibmcloud cdb user-create example-deployment <newusername> <newpassword>
```

Once the task has finished, you can retrieve the new user's connection strings with the `ibmcloud cdb deployment-connections` command.
```sh
ibmcloud cdb deployment-connections example-deployment -u <newusername> [--endpoint-type <endpoint type>]
```

Full connection information is returned by the `ibmcloud cdb deployment-connections` command with the `--all` flag. To retrieve all the connection information for a deployment named "example-deployment", use the following command.
```sh
ibmcloud cdb deployment-connections example-deployment -u <newusername> --all [--endpoint-type <endpoint type>]
```

If you don't specify a user, the `deployment-connections` commands return information for the admin user by default. If you don't specify an endpoint type, the connection string returns the public endpoint by default. If your deployment has only a private endpoint, you must specify `--endpoint-type private` or the commands return an error. The user and endpoint type is not enforced. You can use any user on your deployment with either endpoint (if both exist on your deployment).

### Creating Users and Getting Connection Strings from the API
{: #create-users-get-conn-strings-api}

The _Foundation Endpoint_ that is shown on the _Overview_ panel of your service provides the base URL to access this deployment through the API. To create and manage users, use the base URL with the `/users` endpoint.
```sh
curl -X POST 'https://api.{region}.databases.cloud.ibm.com/v4/ibm/deployments/{id}/users' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $APIKEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"username":"jane_smith", "password":"newsupersecurepassword"}'
```

To retrieve user's connection strings, use the base URL with the `/users/{userid}/connections` endpoint. You must specify in the path which user and which type of endpoint (public or private) should be used in the returned connection strings. The user and endpoint type is not enforced. You can use any user on your deployment with either endpoint (if both exist on your deployment).
```sh
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $APIKEY" 'https://api.{region}.databases.cloud.ibm.com/v4/ibm/deployments/{id}/users/{userid}/connections/{endpoint_type}'
```

More information is available in the [API Reference](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/cloud-databases-api).

### Adding users to _Service Credentials_
{: #add-users-service-cred}

Creating a new user from the CLI or API doesn't automatically populate that user's connection strings into _Service Credentials_. If you want to add them there, you can create a new credential with the existing user information.

Enter the username and password in the JSON field _Add Inline Configuration Parameters_, or specify a file where the JSON information is stored. For example, `{"existing_credentials":{"username":"Robert","password":"supersecure"}}`. The resulting connection strings have the specified username and password that is filled in.

Generating credentials from an existing user does not check for or create that user.

## Connection String Breakdown
{: #conn-strings-breakdown}

### The `grpc` Section
{: #conn-strings-grpc}

The "grpc" section contains information that is suited to applications that make connections to etcd.

Field Name|Index|Description
----------|-----|-----------
`Type`||Type of connection - for etcd, it is "uri"
`Scheme`||Scheme for a URI - for etcd, it is "https"
`Path`||Path for a uri
`Authentication`|`Username`|The username that you use to connect.
`Authentication`|`Password`|A password for the user - might be shown as `$PASSWORD`
`Authentication`|`Method`|How authentication takes place; "direct" authentication is handled by the driver.
`Hosts`|`0...`|A hostname and port to connect to
`Composed`|`0...`|A URI combining Scheme, Authentication, Host, and Path
`Certificate`|`Name`|The allocated name for the self-signed certificate for database deployment
`Certificate`|Base64|A base64 encoded version of the certificate.
{: caption="Table 1. etcd/URI connection information" caption-side="top"}

* `0...` indicates that there might be one or more of these entries in an array.

### The CLI Section
{: #conn-strings-breakdown-cli}

The "CLI" section contains information that is suited for connecting with `etcdctl` .

Field Name|Index|Description
----------|-----|-----------
`Bin`||The recommended binary to create a connection; in this case, it is `etcdctl`.
`Composed`||A formatted command to establish a connection to your deployment. The command combines the `Bin` executable, `Environment` variable settings, and uses `Arguments` as command-line parameters.
`Environment`||A list of key/values you set as environment variables.
`Arguments`|0...|The information that is passed as arguments to the command shown in the Bin field.
`Certificate`|Base64|A self-signed certificate that is used to confirm that an application is connecting to the appropriate server. It is base64 encoded.
`Certificate`|Name|The allocated name for the self-signed certificate.
`Type`||The type of package that uses this connection information; in this case `cli`. 
{: caption="Table 2. etcdctl/cli connection information" caption-side="top"}

* `0...` indicates that there might be one or more of these entries in an array.
