Setting up disk alerts for disk utilization tutorial
:  In this tutorial, you use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API and the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started){: external} to set up an alert that emails you whenever the disk utilization of your database exceeds 90%.

Deploying and Connecting a Cloud Databases Instance Tutorial
:  This tutorial guides you through the process of deploying a {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} instance and connecting it to a web front end by creating a webpage that allows visitors to input a word and its definition.

You install the database infrastructure by using Terraform and your web application uses the popular Express framework. The application can then be run locally, or by using Docker. For more information, see [Deploying and Connecting a {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} Instance](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=cloud-databases-create-instance-tutorial).
