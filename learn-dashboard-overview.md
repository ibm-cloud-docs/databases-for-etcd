# The UI - Dashboard Overview
{: #dashboard-overview}

The _Overview_ page shows you information about your {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd_full}} deployment. The overview includes essential identifying information.
## Overview
### Type
The type of database that is offered by the service, and the database version that your service uses.
### ID
The ID is a [CRN (Cloud Resource Name)](/docs/account?topic=account-crn) which uniquely identifies the database deployment. The CRN is used to refer to the database in the API and can be used with the CLI.The _Overview_ pane shows details of your service.
### Recent Tasks
Every time that you make administrative changes to your service (such as scaling, or taking a manual backup), a task starts up. The _Recent Tasks_ panel shows the task name and progress bar for any running tasks, and a list of the most recent completed tasks. Depending on how busy your deployment is, successful tasks can be shown for 24-48 hours. Unsuccessful tasks can show for 7-8 days. Tasks can also be retrieved from the [Cloud Databases API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloud-databases-api#get-currently-running-tasks-on-a-deployment) and [CLI plug-in](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/databases-cli-plugin?topic=databases-cli-plugin-cdb-reference#deployment-tasks-list). A historical record of tasks from any time period is available through the [{{site.data.keyword.at_full}} integration](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=cloud-databases-activity-tracker).

### Endpoints
The _Endpoints_ pane within the _Overview_ pane contains connection strings for your deployment. Each tab contains connection information tailored to the type of connection or the protocol that uses it. Basic information includes things like _hostname_ and _port_, as well as the TLS self-signed certificate, TLS/SSL parameters, and the default database of your deployment.

Reference tables for the different connection types are available on the [Getting Credentials and Connection Strings](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=databases-for-etcd-connection-strings) page.

Connection strings reflect whether your deployment uses public endpoints, private endpoints or both. You can configure which endpoints are available on your deployment. For more information, see the [Service Endpoints Integration](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=cloud-databases-service-endpoints) page.

You can manage your {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} service through the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} API. This panel provides the essential information for using the API. For more information about the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} API, see the [API reference](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/cloud-databases-api) page.

## Resources
The resources tab contains information and configuration options on the size and resource usage of your deployment. You can 
- [Scale disk, memory, and CPU](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=databases-for-etcd-resources-scaling)
- [Configure Autoscaling](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=databases-for-etcd-autoscaling)

## Backups
The _Backups_ tab is the UI for managing your deployments backups. All of the available backups are listed with their timestamps. Click a backup to grab its ID or to restore it into a new deployment. More information is on the [Managing Backups](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=cloud-databases-dashboard-backups) page.

## Observability
The _Observability_ tab provides access to the IBM Cloud monitoring, logging, and event tracking integrations available for your deployment. 
- [{{site.data.keyword.at_full}}](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=cloud-databases-activity-tracker)
- [{{site.data.keyword.la_full}}](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=cloud-databases-logging)
- [{{site.data.keyword.monitoringfull}}](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=databases-for-etcd-monitoring)
## Settings
The _Settings_ tab contains the UI for many of the tunable settings for your deployment. You can 
- view encryption details. Encryption at rest is enabled for all {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} deployments. If you brought your own encryption key from [Key Protect](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=cloud-databases-key-protect), the panel provides a link to your Key Protect instance and the _Encryption Key_ field has the name of the key.
- [Change the admin password](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=databases-for-etcd-admin-password)
- [Implement or modify an IP allowlist](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=cloud-databases-allowlisting)

## Service Credentials
You can generate a new set of credentials for cases where you want to manually [connect an app](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=databases-for-etcd-ibmcloud-app) or [external consumer](/docs/databases-for-etcd?topic=databases-for-etcd-external-app) to an IBM Cloud service. [Learn more](/docs/account?topic=account-service_credentials).

## Connections
Shows connected resources. You can use the `Create connection` button to to bind this service to another resource.

## View docs
The _View docs_ link from the `Actions` drop list opens the main documentation page for {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} in a new tab.
