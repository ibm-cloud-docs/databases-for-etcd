# Activity Tracker Integration

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd_full}} is integrated with  [Activity Tracker](https://{DomainName}/docs/services/cloud-activity-tracker/activity_tracker_ov.html#activity_tracker_ov), so you can view service-level events.

In order to see the events, you need to [provision the Activity Tracker service](https://{DomainName}/docs/services/cloud-activity-tracker/how-to/provision.html#provision) from the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}  catalog](https://{DomainName}/catalog/services/activity-tracker). Activity Tracker has a _Lite_ plan available at no additional cost.

Once you have the Activity Tracker service, the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-etcd}} events appear under _Account Logs_ from the _View Logs_ dropdown menu. 

In addition to the Activity Tracker UI, the Kibana dashboard is also available at https://logging.ng.bluemix.net.
